 Using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) to measure linear correlation between two variables ,
 given two arrays of data (X, Y) the PCC is calculated for different pairs:
 * (X, Y) 
 * (X^2, Y) 
 * (X^3, Y) 
 * (Log(X), Y) 
 * (X * Log(X), Y) 
 * (X^2 * Log(X), Y) 
 * (X^3 * Log(X), Y) 
 * (2^X, Y)
the best correlation defines the most probable computational complexity among the following possibilities: 
O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n^2 log n), O(n^3), O(2^n)
